        <h2 class="boldlabel">ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my page.
          My name is Harper Woods, and I am a graphic design and UX student in the Pacific Northwest.
          My design perspective is that graphic design is problem-solving. I love being presented with a puzzle and discovering the possibilities.

          The discovery and research process is vital to my work style. I want to understand my clients' needs as deeply as I can so I can deliver solutions that we are both proud of.</p>

        <p class="width"><span class="bold">Judging a book by it's cover.</span>
          The challenge of designing a cover for Macbeth was that the material is so well known, almost everything has been done before.
          The challenge was to make it look fresh. Research and a knowledge of the material allowed me to find layers of meaning that I could translate into crisp, clean illustrations, finally landing on a design that respects the material while making it fresh and interesting.

        <p class="width leftpadding"><span class="bold">Back to basics.</span>
          The National @ the Knitting Factory poster is an entirely analog project. The challenge was to demonstrate a clear illustrative style through pen on paper.This was a very fun challenge that devoured multiple pens and markers in the pursuit of creating something unique and grungy.

We live in a time where it is vital that marginalized voices get to tell their stories and share their experiences, and as allies, the best thing that we can do is listen.
          I modeled the “shushing” hand after the raised fist symbol used in civil rights movements. I felt that by using the same visual language, the context of the message would be more apparent.</p>
